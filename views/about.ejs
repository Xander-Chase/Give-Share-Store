                            We have been doing volunteer donations and pickup for over 20 years... because we care.<br><br>

                            Our commitment is to repurpose your donated furniture and household items to others where most needed within the community.<br><br>
                            
                            Our friendly drivers work hard, but we do ask that you help where able with the heavier items and have the donations ready to go when our volunteers arrive.<br><br>
                            
                            (no stairs please)<br><br>
                            
                            Pickup donation rates apply and will be dependent upon the quantity and size of donated items. We are a non profit group and rely upon your donations to help cover expenses. Household goods as well as monetary donations are all very important to us and the community.<br><br>
                            
                            Please be sure that all donations are clean, in good, reuseable condition (no rips, tears, stains or smoke). Our drivers have the right to refuse any donation deemed unsuitable.
